# AdventOfCode-Java-2023
This repository hosts my solutions to Eric Wastl's Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. Many thanks to Eric for creating these engaging puzzles!

Although I strive for optimal "performance", my goal is to complete the puzzles I have time for. Will most likely lack the knowledge for basic optimization.

It is important to note that this code is by no means a masterpiece, and is far from a Java champion. Haven't touched code since 2021. solutions for all 25 days will never happen.
